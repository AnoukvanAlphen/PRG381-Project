BC Wellness Portal 

Milestone 1

This milestone focuses on the login and registrastion of the BC Student Wellness Portal. The portal is built using Java Servlets and JSP, and this step ensures the development environment and project structure are correctly configured.

Setup 

1. Importing Libraries

Make sure that all required .jar files are added to your Apache NetBeans project’s library:

    Go to:
    Right-click on Project > Properties > Libraries > Compile tab > Add JAR/Folder

    jars used:

       - jbcrypt-0.4.jar

       - jstl.jar

       - postgresql-42.7.7.jar

       - taglibs-standard-impl-1.2.5.jar

       - taglibs-standard-spec-1.2.5.jar


2. Ensuring Correct Project Structure

Make sure the following folder structure is in place:

/ProjectRoot
├── /web
│   └── /WEB-INF
    
       

    If the compiler does not auto-generate the WEB-INF folder under /web, create it manually.
